    <!-- FAQ -->
    <lake-section id="faq" title="Frequently Asked Questions">
      <lake-question title="I am new to fasting. Which schedule should I start with?">
        Do not over analyze. Just start. Aim for 8 hours while you sleep. Feel like you have more in you? Start aiming for 12 hours. Work up to 16, 23, or even 40.
      </lake-question>
      <lake-question title="Will this help me lose weight?">
        Intermittent fasting can support weight loss by helping you eat fewer calories. Fasting Hours helps you stay consistent with your fasting schedule.
      </lake-question>
      <lake-question title="What if I get really hungry during my fast?">
        Until you've taught your brain otherwise, it will want to eat. Stay hydrated. Tracking helps you take a moment to remember who is the boss of you.
      </lake-question>            
      <lake-question title="Is it safe to track everything locally?">
        If you clear your browser's data, you will lose you fasting history. Want import/export, automated backup, and cross-device sync? <a href="https://app.fastinghours.com?signup">Get lifetime access</a>.
      </lake-question>                 
      <lake-question title="Can I use this if I have health conditions?">
        Always consult your doctor before starting any fasting regimen, especially with health conditions. Fasting Hours is a tracking tool, not medical advice.
      </lake-question>                        
      <lake-question title="What if I break my fast early?">
        No problem! Log when you stopped and start fresh next time. Consistency matters more than perfection. Use the data to understand what works for you.
      </lake-question>
